## 🦷 About Me

I am a dental professional deeply interested in the intersection of **dentistry, maxillofacial radiology, and artificial intelligence**. My focus is on exploring how technology can improve radiological analysis, clinical report writing, and dental practice overall.

Currently, I am working on:

- Developing tools for **automated radiological analysis** (2D and 3D).
- Building **clinical voice transcription systems**, integrating NLP to structure clinical data.
- Creating **intelligent templates and systems** for radiological reports in dentistry.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### UlisesAI
A platform focused on **clinical transcription and data structuring** in dentistry. It combines speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to generate structured clinical texts and radiological templates.  
→ *Currently under private development.*

---

### Dental Imaging Tools
A set of tools and scripts designed to facilitate analysis of dental images (2D and 3D). It includes:
- Data extraction and analysis from DICOM files.
- Basic image filtering processes to identify regions of interest.
- Exploratory methods for anatomical segmentation.  
→ *Code kept private due to confidentiality and ongoing development.*

---

### OMFR Radiological Templates
A collection of **structured templates for radiological reports** focused on oral and maxillofacial radiology. Aimed at standardizing clinical language and facilitating integration with digital dental systems.  
→ *Partially available publicly soon.*

---

## ✍️ Current Goals

- Developing **offline voice transcription systems** for clinical environments without internet connectivity.
- Creating algorithms for **automatic detection of early radiological pathologies** in dental images.
